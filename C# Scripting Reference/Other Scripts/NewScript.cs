	Well, here is going to be my first commit of branch 1
	 AAAAAAAAND here is commit #2
	 I added this NewScript to the unity assets folder on the first commit, and then I wrote this comment on the second one.
	
	Well that was interesting, the 2nd branch was completely disintegrated upon merging..
	 
	 
	Ok, something strange happened during the 2nd branch commits. Here is branch 3 commit 1
	Here is a second commit for branch 3, hallelujah!

	I might as well write some real infomration in here. Penguins can fly.
	Update: Penguins can't fly
	I just realized that I was editing the feature and not the branch.. grr
	How do we know that penguins aren't just a government program?
	When I was in highschool I came up with a theory about penguins and Maine
	Basically, nobody has really every touched a real penguin. And there aren't Maine lisnce plates, right?

	The reason penguins cannot fly is because they are robots f2-B3-C1
	Those "scientists" that go out to the arctic to study penguins are just special ops data analysts checking up on the penguin tech.
	
	
	
	Here is the beginning of feature 3. Am i really supposed to repeat all of this 3 times? haha
	Well, penguins are found on every continent.. isn't that crazy?
	F3B2C1 I just realized that I have done all of these commits in the same file for this assignment. Is that what I was supposed to do? That was rhetorical..
	F3B2C2 Have you ever been close enough to a penguin to get a good look at its eyes?
	
	
	Woot! Feature 3, Branch 3. We're almost there!
	Is this it?
